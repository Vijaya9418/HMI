**What is HMI?**

The full form of HMI is Human Machine Interface which is a component and features for car hardware and software applications that allows driver and passangers to engage with the vehile as well as the outside world.


It is used as an operator control panel to PLCs, RTUs, and in some cases directly to IEDs.

It replaces manually activation of switches, dials.

Some examples of common Human Machine Interface devices that we encounter in our daily lives include touchscreens and keyboards. 

A computer program that manages or organize the several other program at the same time.

**Is a HMI a PLC?**

One of the key differences between a PLC and an HMI is their primary function. While a PLC is responsible for executing control logic and managing inputs and outputs, an HMI focuses on providing a user-friendly interface for operators to interact with the system.

**How HMI is connected to PLC?**

HMI & PLC : they are generally connected throw a **Profibus** cable for real time communication.


Human Machine Interface (HMI) and Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) interface with each other by using a communication protocol. This allows the HMI to display real-time information and receive input from the operator, while the PLC can control the operation of the machine or process. Common communication protocols include Modbus, Profinet, and Ethernet/IP. The HMI and PLC can also interface through other industrial protocols such as OPC UA, MQTT, and HTTP. It is important to ensure that the HMI and PLC are compatible and have the same communication protocol in order to establish a successful interface.
